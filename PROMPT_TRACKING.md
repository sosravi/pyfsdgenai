# PyFSD GenAI - User Prompt Tracking & Requirements

## üìã Document Purpose
This document tracks all user prompts, requirements, and preferences to ensure consistent implementation and avoid missing critical details.

## üéØ Core Requirements Summary

### Development Principles (From User Prompts)
1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests first, then implement functionality
2. **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**: Eliminate code duplication through abstraction
3. **Documentation-First**: Document before implementing, maintain docs with code
4. **No Breaking Changes**: Maintain backward compatibility, use semantic versioning
5. **Security-First**: Security validation before any deployment
6. **Pre-validation Testing**: Comprehensive testing before any release
7. **Functionality Validation**: Core principle - comprehensive validation of all features before release
8. **Heavy Unit Testing**: Extensive unit test coverage with edge case validation
9. **Regression Testing**: Comprehensive regression testing before every release
10. **GitHub Pipelines**: Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD (not GitLab)

### Quality Standards
- **Unit Test Coverage**: Minimum 95% test coverage with edge case validation
- **Regression Test Suite**: 100% regression test execution before release
- **Functionality Validation**: All features validated with comprehensive test scenarios
- **Security Scan**: Pass all security checks before deployment
- **Performance Testing**: Meet performance benchmarks
- **Documentation**: Complete and up-to-date documentation
- **Review Process**: All code must pass peer review

## üìù Detailed Prompt History

### Prompt 1: Initial Project Setup

**Prompt**: "in github_sos directory, create another directory next to kosa and call it pyfsdgenai, init a github repo there and create project requirment documentation for a project being mentioned in the requirements below

The application being supported is a product that they customize for their clients: ? AI based application that works in the procurement domain, solves problems of basic invoice reconciliation (takes contracts in using GenAI, 20 agents sitting in background looking for stuff like pricing, etc), creates a dataset, then works on processing associated reconciliation ‚Äì find places where pricing/discount structures exist in the contracts.
